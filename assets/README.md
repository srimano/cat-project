# Coder Girl Web Development Cohort
## Kat's Costume Shop

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile-first, responsive website to showcase the HTML and CSS skills you have acquired!

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. This is a mobile-first site. Build the mobile version of the website first. Do **not** use any of the media selectors yet.
3. Once you are happy with the mobile version of your site, add support for sizes wider than 660px. Now use the 660px media selector.
4. Finally, add support for formats wider than 940px. Now use the 940px media selector.

## Structure of the repository

* The mobile and desktop design mockups are in `/design`.
* The images you will need are in `/assets/images`.
* The text seen in the designs is already typed out in `index.html`.
* There are already media selectors for handling larger website formats in the CSS file.

The rest is up to you to build out! Good luck. Remember to ask your mentors and peers questions in Slack!
